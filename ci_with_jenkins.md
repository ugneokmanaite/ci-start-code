### Testing types and methods will depend on companies
- We will use Jenkins- they may use different CI/CD tools!
- Procedures/ Platforms will depend


## Where does DevOps come into this?
- SDLC used to be very slow!- New ideas would take long to implament
- Risk of software being released with flaws used to be much higher!
- DevOps allows you to develop and release more products with improved speed, quality and reduced costs
- Need for DevOps came from companies doing agile 
- Agile & DevOps combine collective effrots to incorporate CI/CD so that software updates and development keeps going throughout the year 
- Checks & balances of both make sure that each small change can compile effectively and seamlessly with original software and changed made by other developers
