# Why should we use SSH with GitHub or anything else?


## SSH Keys & Github

### There are 2 methods to clone the repo
``` 
SSH and HTTPS
```
- We have 2 types of repos :
```
Public and Private
```

- Generate SSH keys on your local system
- Copy the key from local system to the specific repo on Github (ci-start-code)
- .ssh folder where we have SSH keys available
- Name the new key as your name e.g. ugne

1. ```ls -a``` in home dir
2. ``` cd.shh/```
3. ``` ls``` shows all the current keys 
4. ``` ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "uokmanaite@spartaglobal.com"```
5. ``` cat ugne.pub```
6. Copy the key
7. Go on github repo -settings -deploy keys - add deploy key
8. Paste the link and use same name 
9. Now the key is aded to Github
10. To change you would have to delete and add new one

### It is essential to write descriptive names e.g. ugne-jenkins
- knowing which keys to link with what 

Now the secured public key from your local system has been copied to the cloud/Github


- jenkins.pub (private key access) is the same as having a padlock (easy to understand)
- so we need to use the private key which will work as a normal key which will be used in jenkins to open the required file

# CI in Jenkins 

## What is ci?
- Continuous integration

## Why should we use ci?
- Allows multiple users to work on a project and for continuous interation>
- When we have pushed before it has been manually everytime we wanted to d>
- Now we will use Jenkins

## How does it help in DevOps culture?
- Makes the transition between code writing and intergration smoother
- Automated process 

## What is Jenkins?
-  An open source automation server which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software

1. SOURCE 
2. BUILD 
3. TEST

## What is the difference between CI (continuous integration) and CID (continuous deployment)

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- Merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day
- CI Model takes Agile a step further by automating the integration and Testing
- Developer submits only small segments of the application at a time
- This is then saved & automatically sent to build server immediately or at regular intervals throughout the day
- Build is then automatically passd to a test server that executes a series of automated unit tests to ensure that new code segments work as planned



## Continuous delivery (CDE) 
- Is done manually 
- Code is compiled, tested and dropped into the staging environment


## Continuous deployment (CD)

- Enables deveopment team to integrate code segments to the production envrionment several times per day 
- Application of CD can be found at number of large organisations e.g. Amazon, Google
- Allows them to ssign developers to a specific set of functions to which they will continually work on and improve upon based on user feedback
- Because of the small iterative changes that are constantly being added and updated to the production product, the users donâ€™t experience any big changes that can sometimes cause consumer anxiety
- Once the developer saves the new code, it is automatically built, integrated, tested, and deployed directly to the production environment
